# sql-challenge
repo for sql homework using PostgreSQL

## Background

It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.
For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.

This repo contains folder EmployeeSQL under which the Required queries are found in DataAnalysis.sql 
Under this folder is the data folder that contains the QuickDBD-EmployeeDB.png image, and the .sql for creating the table schemas. 
As well as the required data as .csv files.
